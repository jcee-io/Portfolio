            This is a boilerplate I've created in order to ease future developments when I develop
            future projects that require authentication. It's also doubles as a React-Router boilerplate.
            Future developments will include styling, making a different version with a different database,
            and include social media authentication in order to hit the ground running when developing
            a new project.
