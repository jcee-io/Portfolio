            This is a small boiletplate that uses the Vue CLI, but instead of just a dev server, a regular
            node server was created through the use of a proxy in conjunction with the dev server in order
            to make a full stack application instead of the exclusive front end the Vue CLI provides.

            This is a boilerplate I've created in order to ease future developments when I develop
            future projects that require authentication. It's also doubles as a React-Router boilerplate.
            Future developments will include styling, making a different version with a different database,
            and include social media authentication in order to hit the ground running when developing
            a new project.
